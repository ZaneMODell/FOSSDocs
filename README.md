FOSSDocs is a native Android fully on-device document viewer where users can view their documents, search their contents, and have a seamless experience all without needing to rely on Google services or another device default document viewer. 

This application is currently under development, and a project for me to learn native Android development while increasing my skills in the Kotlin programming language. 

If you wish to contribute to the project/want to assist me in my learning or have any questions about it, please email me at zanemodell@gmail.com. Thanks!
